## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Install python3
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```
- Install pip for Python 3
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the repository and change to web-project directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Javigoo/web-project.git
cd web-project/
```

Activate the virtual environment using:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

We can deactivate it typing:
```
deactivate
```

“requirements.txt” is a file containing a list of items to be installed using pip
install like so:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Apply a migration to tell Django what changes need to be made to the database
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Check if the install worked successfully running it
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
